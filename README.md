By default JSONToExcel accept an array of objects and generate an excel file with only one sheet.

An nested object will not be accepted and will return nothing the item with a value of an object

```js
[
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "Joe",
    age: 10,
  },
];
```

`Multiple sheet excel file`

With JSONToExcel you can create one excel file with different sheets with different content as you like.
All you have to do is change the default format of your data.
If the data structured correctly it will generate an excel file with multiple sheets without requiring more props or other configurations.

Here is an example of the acceptable data format for multiple sheets excel file.

```js
[
  {
    sheetName: "Group A",
    data: [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: "John",
        age: 30,
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: "Joe",
        age: 10,
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    sheetName: "Group B",
    data: [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: "John",
        age: 20,
      },
    ],
